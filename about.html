                <p>Xnovo Technology ApS is the commercial result of more than 20 years of Synchrotron and
                    Diffraction-Imaging research at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

                    Driven by an urge to make 3D crystallographic X-ray technology accessible for a wider range of
                    materials scientists, Xnovo Technology ApS was founded in December 2012 by Senior Scientist Erik
                    Mejdal Lauridsen, DTU-Energy Conversion, and Professor Henning Friis Poulsen, DTU-Physics.</p>

            <h3>“As a scientist, I was frustrated that only a handful of people had access to our advanced 3D
                synchrotron imaging techniques. Now a much wider audience of companies and research institutions can
                harvest the benefits from 3D X-ray crystallographic imaging,” </h3>
            <p>says founder and CEO Erik Mejdal

                <h2>From university research to commercial company</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>The transition from university research into a commercial company was supported by the tech oriented
                    venture fund Capnova and Vækstforum Sjælland.</p>
                <p> The first commercial application of Xnovo’s patent portfolio was the partnership with Carl Zeiss
                    X-ray Microscopy Inc. The 3D crystallographic imaging solution GrainMapper3D™ was made available as
                    part of the LabDCT™ module on the ZEISS Xradia 520 Versa X-ray Microscope mid-2015.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>Through close collaborations with leading research institutions, Xnovo seeks to bring
                    state-of-the-art analysis tools to our customers. To this end we have engaged in a range of
                    collaborative projects, and we are always interested in hearing from new potential partners.</p>
                <p>
                    In particular, Xnovo still has strong ties to the Danish academic community educating the talents of
                    the future. We are happy to co-supervise students at all levels, and as a special initiative aimed
                    at encouraging excellent young researchers to pursue a career in X-ray science, Xnovo supports the
                    annual Danscatt PhD award.</p>
