          <h2>Metal failure and microstructure</h2>
          <h3>
            By Dorte Juul Jensen, Professor at Department of Wind Energy,
            Technical University of Denmark (DTU)
          </h3>
          <p>
            “The LabDCT module on our ZEISS Xradia 520 Versa 3D X-ray microscope
            with its GrainMapper3D software is a huge progress and very
            important for us at the Technical University of Denmark in mapping
            the microstructure of materials. Using this new tool we now have the
            ability to see the development in how metals crack when exposed to
            heat or mechanical loading and relate the observed failure modes to
            the surrounding grain structure. This information is crucial for our
            research.
          </p>
          <h3>A lot of tests – whenever we want</h3>
          <p>
            Another aspect is the possibility to perform a lot of tests whenever
            we want. Often you need to do hundreds of tests and then it is
            important to have the microscope nearby.
          </p>
          <p>
            The alternative would be the large-scale synchrotron research
            facilities, but they are very difficult to book, requires
            substantial more preparation, and do generally only provide beam
            time for high-profile scientific breakthrough studies, whereas other
            important, but more technical oriented studies like e.g. parameter
            optimization etc. finds it harder to be granted beam time.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a scientist, I am happy to see a company like Xnovo Technology
            spread this technology around the world, so the level of materials
            science can be improved much faster.”

          <h2>Visualizing materials interfaces in 3D</h2>
          <h3>
            By Ashwin J. Shahani, Assistant Professor at the University of
            Michigan.
          </h3>
          <p>
            “Having the LabDCT is quite instrumental for my group, because we
            can verify the theories and simulations of grain boundary structure
            and motion with very high precision. It allows us to perform in situ
            tests such as annealing to see how the polycrystalline material
            evolves in time, without having to repeatedly destroy the sample. In
            addition to grain structure, we can capture the locations of
            second-phase particles (such as impurities) on the same device, and
            on a large variety of materials.”
          </p>
          <h3>LabDCT is suited for a diverse array of materials</h3>
          <p>
            “Our group is interested in a number of problems that can be
            immediately addressed using the LabDCT on campus: For one, we seek
            to uncover the complex network of interfaces and particles in
            semiconductors, which is critical for their performance in
            commercial applications, e.g., solar cells. Our work with
            polycrystalline silicon has addressed this issue. A second interest
            is to understand how aluminum-based alloys evolve under the
            application of heat. In certain scenarios, one grain in the
            polycrystal may catastrophically “eat up” its neighbors, thereby
            leading to materials failure. In both projects, the fundamental
            question is, what do the interfaces look like in 3D and based on the
            network of the interfaces, what does this means for performance?
            Other groups on campus are also quite interested in the capabilities
            of LabDCT, and particularly for battery materials. There is interest
            over a wide variety of applications that underlines the power and
            compatibility of LabDCT for different experiments.”
          </p>
          <h3>GrainMapper3D version 2.0 works very well</h3>
          <p>
            “We have done a lot of benchmarking tests on the GrainMapper3D
            version 2.0 and it works well for us. We have now determined what
            samples are best for the equipment and the ensuing reconstruction,
            preparing for very long in situ experiments to study interfacial
            evolution as a function of time in repeated anneal cycles. When I
            first started at Michigan, we used to do all our experiments at the
            synchrotron user facility and come back with loads of data. The
            LabDCT is right here, accessible, within reach, providing data
            around the clock. For us that is a major benefit. Even if we need
            the synchrotron for ultrafast experiments, we use the LabDCT for
            trial runs to precheck the microstructure of our samples and
            determine if they are suitable for the synchrotron experiments.”
          </p>
          <h3>The extra push</h3>
          <p>
            “Xnovo have always been very helpful debugging the reconstructions,
            whenever we needed the extra push. It’s always great to collaborate
            with them and really adopt the LabDCT technique here on campus. We
            extend our thanks to Erik, Nicolas, Jun, and the rest of the
            scientists at Xnovo.”

          <h2>Deformation and granular mechanics</h2>
          <h3>
            By Stephen Hall, Senior Lecturer at Department of Solid Mechanics,
            Lund University.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Stephen has worked for over ten years with synchrotron research, and
            he was introduced to GrainMapper3D on LabDCT in 2017. “You can go to
            the synchrotron a couple of times a year and do experiments with one
            or two samples, which is not enough for scientific analysis – you
            just have to hope for the best. With the LabDCT we’re able to do a
            campaign and really investigate material behavior, different types
            of loading, and many other things. At our lab we want to see how far
            we can push the LabDCT to measure the deformation of materials –
            this is an open question for the moment.
          </p>
          <p>I’m using the LabDCT for two main areas:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Recrystallization and deformation of metallic materials, such as
              steel (for structural applications) and aluminum (e.g. foils and
              packaging)
            </li>
            <li>
              Granular mechanics, e.g. understanding force transmission and
              failure in granular materials. This is something I’ve done a lot
              on the synchrotron. Transfer this to a lab, and it will make a
              massive difference.”
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Easy to use and provides us with tons of data</h3>
          <p>
            “So far the GrainMapper3D software essentially is very easy to use,
            and very straightforward. I’m surprised how easy it is to run the
            analysis. It’s organized in a very simple way with a limited number
            of steps required to get results, and it provides us with tons of
            data. I’m looking forward to the version 2.0, because it has a lot
            of the add-ons, which we would like to employ.”
